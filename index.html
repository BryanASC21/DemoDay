    </header>
<div id = "bigdiv">
    <p>  Picking which college you choose to attend is one of the most hardest and important one that you will choose. 
    Depending on which college you go to, will affect the type of education you recieve, to who will accept you when applying to jobs
    or graduate programs. But how do you know which is the best college for you? Having an idea of carrer you want to pursue can help you out.
    Certain schools are better then others depending on the type of field you want to study. Also the cost of each school, proximity to where you currently live,
    and where you feel the most comfortable are important factors. Many sites often rank many schools to determine which is the best for a certain field of study.
